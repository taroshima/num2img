# Num2Img

A package to convert numbers to images. This package converts very large decimal numbers to hext and then uses hex to generate an image. The image is a 2D array of pixels with each pixel representing a hex digit. The image is saved as a .png file.

Added functionality to convert images to hexadecimal in the hope of decreasing the file size for efficient storage. Didn't pan out how we expected so new branch created with compression and decompression algorithms.
